## About 

I made this site for the Cloudflare Summer Challenge, and tyred making it the best I can.

This used [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv).

Third-party services: [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) and [Tebi](https://tebi.io/).
* hCaptcha for protecting register form.
* Tebi for image/file hosting (Cloudflare R2?? I WANT YOU :P)

When making this site I aimed to provide the most useful features to all users, and for all different levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced dives.

## Notes

* I'm am not the best at front-end development, so the pages may not be as pretty as I would like. I tried by best.

* All pictures are taking by me, but are no included in the repo.

* I eventually plan on continuing this site in the future. Adding more features, sharing with other people, get feedback, and help on the site. Though for now, its just my submission for the Cloudflare summer challenge.
